Welcome to **Introduction to Gridap: Simulating PDEs using finite elements in Julia âœ¨ 28-29th, Nov, 2023**

This two-day hands-on workshop will showcase the main features of [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl), an ecosystem of software packages for the simulation of problems governed by PDEs
written in the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org/).
