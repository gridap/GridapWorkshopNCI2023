## Workshop description

This two-day hands-on workshop will showcase the main features of [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl), an ecosystem of software packages for the simulation of problems governed by PDEs
written in the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org/).

Gridap has a very expressive user interface, allowing one to solve complex PDE systems by stating the problem using whiteboard notation. It implements multiple state-of-the-art finite element methods that can efficiently exploit large-scale HPC supercomputers.

The workshop will be tutorial-based and will cover the main features of Gridap, its application to several problems, and its deployment in distributed memory machines. There will also be a brief introduction to finite element methods addressed to participants without previous background in these techniques.

The emphasis will be mainly on presenting the main software abstractions underlying these packages and how these can be combined to solve a variety of PDEs with application to different problems in science and engineering.  The choice of the PDE systems to be discussed in the workshop will be based on the participant's interests gathered during registration.  

Funding is available to cover the accommodation and travel expenses of research students. Participants must bring their own laptops. Instructions will be provided to install the software before the actual workshop takes place.
